<h1>Censored keyboard</h1>

<p>Between 1928 and 2013, Turkish law forbade the use of the letters Q, W, and X in official documents. This was part of
  a wider initiative to stifle Kurdish culture—those letters occur in the language used by Kurdish people but not in Istanbul Turkish.<br/>

  As an exercise in doing ridiculous things with technology, I’m asking you to program a text field (an &lt;input type="text"> tag) that
  these letters cannot be typed into.<br/>

  (Do not worry about copy and paste and other such loopholes.)</p>

<input type="text" style="border: 3px solid black;">
<script>
  var field = document.querySelector("input");
  // Your code here.

  field.addEventListener('keypress', function(event) {
    if(event.keyCode == 81 || event.keyCode == 87 || event.keyCode == 88 || event.keyCode == 113 || event.keyCode == 119 || event.keyCode == 120) {
      field.style.borderColor = 'red';
      event.preventDefault();
    } else {
      field.style.borderColor = 'black';
    }
  });
</script>
