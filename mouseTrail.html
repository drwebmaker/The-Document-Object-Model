<h1>Mouse trail</h1>

<p>In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages with lots of animated images, people came up
  with some truly inspiring ways to use the language.</p>

<p>One of these was the “mouse trail”—a series of images that would follow the mouse pointer as you moved it across the page.</p>

<p>In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely positioned &lt;div> elements with a fixed size
  and background color (refer to the code in the “Mouse Clicks” section for an example). Create a bunch of such elements
  and, when the mouse moves, display them in the wake of the mouse pointer.</p>

<p>There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution as simple or as complex as you want. A simple
  solution to start with is to keep a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving the next one to the
  mouse’s current position every time a "mousemove" event occurs.</p>

<script>
  addEventListener('mousemove', function(event) {
    var dot = document.createElement("div");
    dot.className = "dot";
    dot.style.position = "absolute";
    dot.style.left = (event.pageX - 5) + "px";
    dot.style.top = (event.pageY - 5) + "px";
    document.body.appendChild(dot);
  });
</script>
